          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and % In Poverty, Median Age, and Median Household Income</h2>
          <p>Poverty Level %:
              <ul>vs. Lacks Healthcare %: There appears to be a direct relationship between the variables for the majority of states.  When the poverty level is low so is the % of the population lacking healthcare.</ul>
              <ul>vs. Smokes %: No strong relationship between the variables.  Across multiple poverty levels, the % of the population that smokes falls between 12 & 22.  There are a handful of states where there is a direct relationship - see AL, LA, and MS.</ul>
              <ul>vs. Obesity %: Similar to smoking, there is no strong relationship between the variables.  Across multiple poverty levels, the % of the population that is obese falls between 24 and 34.  A primary outlier however is MS, where poverty and obesity are both high.</ul>
            </p>

          <p>Median Age:
            <ul>vs. Lacks Healthcare %: No strong relationship between the variables.  The majority of states report a median age between 36 and 41, but the % of the population lacking healthcare varies greatly, between 6 and 22.</ul>
            <ul>vs. Smokes %: Similar to healthcare, no direct relationship between the variables.  The majority of states report a median age between 36 and 41, but the % of the population that smokes is more narrow, between 14 and 22.  There are some outliers however - see UT (low age, low smoking) and WV (high age, high smoking).</ul>
            <ul>vs. Obesity %: No strong relationship between the variables.  The common median age is 36 to 41 and the % of the population that is obese falls between 26 and 34.  There are more outliers where obesity is low - see states CA, CO, DC, HI, and MA.</ul>
          </p>

          <p>Median Household Income:
            <ul>vs. Lacks Healthcare %: There is a mild indirect relationship between the variables: the lower the median household income, the higher the % of the population that lacks healthcare.  This relationship is probable though, as more money would provide more security in affording healthcare.</ul>
            <ul>vs. Smokes %: Similar to healthcare, there is an indirect relationship between the variables.  States with a lower household income have a higher % of the their population that smoke - notably AR, KY, MS, and WV.</ul>
            <ul>vs. Obesity %: There is a mild indirect relationship between the variables, but as income increases, the relationship is less strong.  Across many incomes, the % of the population that is obese ranges between 24 and 34.</ul>
